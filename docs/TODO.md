# TODOs

## Highest priority

## Very high priority
- [ ] Design better generator function for the training_set.
- [ ] Utilize python curse module instead of classic print for a better output visualization.
- [ ] Try the SGD method with a bigger dataset whose informations are already known (for example accuracy after N steps).
- [ ] Starting to output some plots.
- [ ] Improve all gd performances.

## High priority
- [ ] Add validation.
- [ ] Get rid of all deepcopy functions and consequently improve dataset management.
- [ ] Implement smart recognizing of activation_function based on training_set output values.

## Medium priority 
- [ ] Consider a non-constant learning rate.
- [ ] Starting reasoning with Expanders.

## Low priority
- [ ] Try a different function to minimize: rather than mean square error consider instead something like **cross entropy** .

## Lowest priority
- [ ] Graphical interface with PyQt.
